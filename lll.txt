I have always been curious and interested in Neural networks and Computer Vision, and that interest has always pushed me to learn more in the subject. I am looking for experience and knowledge in the field and this research has really made me curious. I am a senior at UIC pursuing computer engineering, I will be graduating in Fall 2020. My course work in computer vision, data structures, Embedded Systems, Digital systems, and Circuit analysis helped me to gain knowledge in the field of Computer Engineering. 




My course work in computer vision, data structures, Embedded Systems, Digital systems, and Circuit analysis helped me to gain knowledge in the field of Computer Engineering. Apart from the course work my curiosity pushed me to get a certification in Artificial Intelligence using Python from Udacity. In the certification, I learned about different neural network architecture, forward propagation,backward propagation. My course work in computer vision helped me get a solid foundation in image processing and analysis.

I do not have any prior research experience but, I am looking for an opportunity to get involved in research opportunity. 

I have taken courses like Computer Vision, Data Structures, Embedded Systems, Circuit analysis, Discrete and Continuous Signals and Systems, Probability and Random Processes for Engineers and Digital Systems.   

I would really appreciate the opportunity to work in your lab and gain experience. Thank you so much for your time and consideration.
